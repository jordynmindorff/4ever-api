# 4ever - Memory Keeper API

## Description

This is the REST API backend for the "4ever" memory application that I made as a side project. Full CRUD functionality for memories as well as a 'Bearer token' authentication system with error handling is implemented in this API.

A PostgreSQL database is used to store data. I intentionally didn't use an ORM package to get some practice with SQL queries.

See [this](https://github.com/jordynmindorff/4ever-app) for the frontend (with pictures).
